# DAQx
DAQx is MATLAB GUI application made for data acquisition (with NI devices)

## Why?
To have a single application that manages acquisition devices setup and acquire the data without spending much time on coding.

## How do I...
### Install the application?
Requirements:
  * MATLAB R2022b (compatibility with other versions is to be checked)
  * NI DAQmx drivers (compatible with your acquisition device)
  * Data Acquisition Toolbox
### Use the application?
